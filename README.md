# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

## Description

This was week one homework assignment involving a very important aspect of web development: **accessibility**. The homework assignement was to refactor an existing site to make it more accessible. 

Web accessibility ensures that people with disabilities can access a website using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. 

Even though accessibility is a broad topic that can include complex requirements, your tech lead has given you a small list of specific criteria to satisfy the project. These criteria are documented below in the Acceptance Criteria.

## Original Mock-up

**Note**: This layout is designed for "desktop", so you may notice that some of the elements don't look like the Mock-Up when viewed at a resolution smaller than 768px. 
The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:

## Tasks Completed
**Scout Rule** Tasks Performed:
* Fixed broken link
* Updated HTML to semantic structure, changing div elements to semantic elements
* Added spacing to make code more readable
* Added type attribute to stylesheet
* Reworked the CSS to make it more efficient by consolidating CSS selectors and properties, organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements.

**Accessibility** Tasks Performed:
* Moved title element to top of head and updated website to company name in HTML
* Added alt attribute to all images
	- Added description to the alt attribute to images that add to the written content. Did not include description to alt attribute ("") to images that are either decorative or supplemental to the rest of the content (i.e. background image in CSS), redundant with some other information in the document (i.e. the icon images).
